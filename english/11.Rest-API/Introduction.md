# Introduction

**The OCS Inventory REST API** has been created to help third party program to retrieve our inventory informations. This documentation will help you to  install, configure and use our API. 

Note : This documentation has been done on Debian 9, some path might differ if you use another distribution.

In the first place, we recommand you to learn how to configuration and how to setup autentification for our API:
1. [Configuration](Configuration.md)
2. [Authentification](Authentification.md)

If you want to know which routes are available see : 
* [GET Routes](GET-Routes.md)
* [POST Routes (not implemented)](POST-Routes.md)
* [DELETE Routes (not implemented)](DELETE-Routes.md)
* [PUT Routes (not implemented)](PUT-Routes.md)
