# CVE Reporting

CVE Reporting has ben added in release 2.x of OCS Inventory. 
By enabling this feature, OCS Inventory can automatically query a 
[cve-search](http://cve-search.github.io/cve-search/) server for 
vulnerabilities that may apply to your inventoried softwares.

**`Warning : CVE Reporting is a feature for informational purposes. OCS Inventory does not guarantee the accuracy of the informations provided.`**

## Configuring the CVE-Search management

As administrator, go to the menu ```Configuration > General configuration```, 
and click on the "CVE-search management" entry in the left navigation pane:

![cve-search left navigation pane](../../img/server/reports/cvesearch_config_pane_entry.png)

There are 3 settings :
+ **VULN_CVESEARCH_ENABLE** : Define wether the integration is enabled or not (default : Disabled);
+ **VULN_CVESEARCH_HOST** : Define the URL of the cve-search server to be queried (You may use https://cve.circl.lu if you don't host any cve-search server).
+ **VULN_BAN_LIST** : Select software categories that you do not want to process.

## Configure CronTab

In your server, configure a CronTab to call the file cron_cve.php in

    ocsreports/crontab/cron_cve.php

To clean CVE, configure a CronTab to call the file cron_clean_cve.php

    ocsreports/crontab/cron_clean_cve.php

**`Note`**`: It's recommended to execute the crontab at night`

## Features

When CVE-Search has been enabled and crontab cron_cve.php has been executed, click on ```Inventory > CVE Reporting ```.
